# C++ Fundamentals Project

## Project Overview

This C++ project serves as a comprehensive example to understand and practice fundamental concepts in C++ programming. The project covers the following key concepts:

1. **Classes:** Demonstration of object-oriented programming by creating a class with member variables and member functions.

2. **For Loop:** Illustration of the `for` loop for iterative tasks.

3. **While Loop:** Implementation of the `while` loop for repetitive tasks.

4. **Switch:** Utilization of the `switch` statement for multi-branch decision-making.

5. **Input-Output:** User input and output operations using `cin` and `cout`.

6. **Constructors:** Implementation of constructors for initializing class objects.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-fundamentals.git
